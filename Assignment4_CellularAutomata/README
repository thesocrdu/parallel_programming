Simulates Conway's Game of Life using MPI

Tools used: OpenMPI, C language

How to build:
Use the command: "mpicc gameoflife.c -o gameoflife"
Then issue the command to run: "mpirun -np <numProc> ./gameoflife"

Where <numProc> is the number of processors you want to run the program with.

NOTE: This MPI implementation only works with 1,2,4,8 and 16 processors.
